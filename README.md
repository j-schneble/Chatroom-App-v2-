# Chatroom-App-v2-
An upgraded and more secure version of my chatroom application (iChat). Created using Socket.IO, React.js will now be rendering the front, and Node/Express for the back.

Install the necessary project dependencies in Front and Back:
```bash
npm install
```
Client runs on http://localhost:8080

Open and run Server Folder:
```bash
npm start
```

Open and run Client Folder:
```bash
npm start
```
